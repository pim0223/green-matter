# Green matter
Bringing green down to earth

## Set-up
- Make sure you set up a clean environment using conda or virtualenv (read [this primer](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/) for more info)
- Install the project dependencies into your environment using `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `conda install --file requirements.txt`
- Apply the database migrations by running `python manage.py migrate` in the root directory
- Run the app using `python manage.py runserver`
- Open `localhost:8000` in your browser, you should now see the landing page!
